# Wine-Review-Jupyter-Notebook

Cleaning and exploration of a wine data set. Found which country wine is most expensive in,
the most frequent wine reviewer, and price vs. rating for wines from Argentina. This project 
helped me learn about cleaning data (removing duplicates, fixing column names, etc.) in 
Pandas and NumPy. It also introduced me to using MatPlotLib.

This project can be viewed via the notebook above.
